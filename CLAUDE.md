# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with type generation (combines `wrangler types && wrangler dev`)
- `pnpm start` - Alternative development server command
- `pnpm cf-typegen` - Generate TypeScript types from Wrangler configuration

## Quality Assurance Commands

**CRITICAL**: Always run these commands after code changes to ensure zero errors before task completion.

- `pnpm lint:check` - ESLint with zero warnings tolerance (strict mode)
- `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm format:check` - Prettier format checking
- `pnpm lint` - ESLint with auto-fix (use for fixing, not checking)
- `pnpm format` - Prettier with auto-format (use for fixing, not checking)

### Quality Check Workflow

```bash
# After any code changes, run these in sequence:
pnpm lint:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm format:check
```

**Never complete tasks with unresolved errors from these commands.**

## Architecture Overview

This is a Cloudflare Workers application built with Hono framework and TypeScript. The architecture consists of:

### Core Components

- **Main Worker** (`src/index.ts`) - Hono application serving as the entry point with basic routing
- **Echo Durable Object** (`src/echo/index.ts`) - Implements the core Echo functionality as a Durable Object with RPC methods

### Cloudflare Resources

- **Durable Object**: `Echo` class bound as `ECHO` - provides persistent state and RPC capabilities
- **KV Namespace**: `ECHO_KV` - key-value storage for the application
- **SQLite**: Configured for the Echo Durable Object via migrations

### Key Patterns

- The main worker routes requests to Durable Object instances using `c.env.ECHO.idFromName()`
- Durable Objects expose RPC methods that can be called directly from the worker
- Type definitions are auto-generated by Wrangler and stored in `worker-configuration.d.ts`

### Entry Points

- Root path `/` returns a simple status message
- All paths under `/rin/*` are routed to an Echo Durable Object instance named "Rin"

Always run `wrangler types` when making changes to `wrangler.jsonc` to keep TypeScript definitions up to date.

## OpenAI Usage Management

This application includes comprehensive OpenAI API usage tracking and management to prevent unexpected token consumption.

### Architecture

**OpenAIClient** (`src/llm/openai/client.ts`)

- `call()` method returns cumulative `ResponseUsage` across all recursive function calls
- Automatically logs warning when API response lacks usage information

**Echo Durable Object** (`src/echo/index.ts`)

- Accumulates daily usage statistics in Durable Object storage
- Implements dynamic token limits based on time-proportional allocation
- Stores usage data by date: `{ "2025-07-28": ResponseUsage, ... }`

### Dynamic Token Limiting

**Algorithm:**

```typescript
// Base settings
DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT = 1,000,000 tokens
USAGE_BUFFER_FACTOR = 1.5x

// Dynamic calculation
idealUsage = DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT × (currentHour / 24)
dynamicLimit = min(idealUsage × BUFFER_FACTOR, DAILY_TOKEN_LIMIT)
```

**Examples:**

- 06:00 → 375,000 tokens allowed (250k × 1.5)
- 12:00 → 750,000 tokens allowed (500k × 1.5)
- 18:00 → 1,000,000 tokens allowed (750k × 1.5, capped at daily limit)

### HTTP Endpoints

**Usage Statistics:**

- `GET /rin/` - Returns Echo status including `allUsage` field
- `GET /rin/usage` - Full usage history
- `GET /rin/usage/today` - Today's usage
- `GET /rin/usage/:date` - Specific date usage (format: YYYY-MM-DD, e.g., 2025-07-28)

### Operational Notes

**Threshold Monitoring:**

- Pre-execution check prevents API calls when dynamic limit exceeded
- Detailed violation logs include current time, limit, actual usage, and daily cap
- Early termination preserves remaining daily quota for later hours

**Usage Data Structure:**

```typescript
ResponseUsage {
  input_tokens: number
  input_tokens_details: { cached_tokens: number }
  output_tokens: number
  output_tokens_details: { reasoning_tokens: number }
  total_tokens: number
}
```

**Configuration Adjustment:**
Monitor violation logs and daily surplus patterns to optimize `USAGE_BUFFER_FACTOR` (currently 1.5x). Consider time-of-day specific multipliers if usage patterns show consistent trends.
